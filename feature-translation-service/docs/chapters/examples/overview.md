# Overview

> **_NOTE:_**  *For just viewing examples, and no extra explanation, I've included a few Jupyter notebooks in the cloned repository under: <span style="color:blue"> feature-translation-service/examples/Jupyter Notebooks.*</span>



In this section I'll present a few examples of how to use PO.DAAC's Feature Translation Service. These examples include querying by _SWOT Feature ID_, _HUC_, and by _region name_ and by _partial_ or _exact_ matches. Also, I'll include examples of how this can be used to then query CMR.

**Prerequisites:** You'll need to have both the BeautifulSoup and the requests package installed. Run:

```
pip install bs4 requests
```

if you do not have them installed, or want to confirm that you do.
